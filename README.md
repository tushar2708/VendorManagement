# VendorManagement

A web application for managing an organization's vendors — the companies and
individuals that supply goods and services. It centralizes vendor records,
contracts, and communications so procurement and finance teams have a single,
reliable source of truth.

## What it does

Vendor Management replaces scattered spreadsheets and email threads with one
place to onboard, track, and evaluate suppliers across their lifecycle.

### Core features

- **Vendor directory** — Maintain a searchable catalog of vendors with contact
  details, categories, tax/legal identifiers, and status (active, pending,
  suspended, archived).
- **Onboarding** — Capture the documents and approvals a new vendor needs
  (registration details, banking info, compliance documents) through a guided
  intake flow.
- **Contracts & renewals** — Store contract terms, start/end dates, and renewal
  reminders so agreements don't lapse unnoticed.
- **Documents & compliance** — Attach and version key files (agreements,
  insurance certificates, tax forms) and flag ones that are missing or expired.
- **Performance tracking** — Record ratings, notes, and issues over time to
  inform which vendors to keep, grow, or replace.
- **Roles & permissions** — Separate what buyers, approvers, and administrators
  can view and change.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend** — React 19, Vite, TypeScript, and React Router 7
- **Backend** — Express 5 and TypeScript
- **Authentication** — Better Auth inside the Express API
- **Database** — Neon Postgres
- **Database access** — Prisma
- **Validation** — Zod
- **UI** — Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- **Motion** — Paid Animmaster Library components
- **Tests** — Vitest, React Testing Library, Supertest, and Playwright
- **Package management** — npm workspaces
- **Deployment** — One Docker image on Railway

## Application structure

The frontend and backend remain separate applications:

- `apps/web` — React frontend
- `apps/api` — Express backend
- `packages/shared` — Shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- `packages/db` — Prisma schema, generated client, and migrations

The Dockerfile builds both applications in separate stages. The Express API serves the built React application in production.

## Getting started

> Prerequisite: Node.js 22+ and npm.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The exact local URLs will be documented when the application servers are added.

## Deployment

Railway builds the root `Dockerfile` and runs the backend server. The backend serves the frontend build from the same Docker image.

Railway checks the backend health endpoint at `/api/health`.

## Environment variables

Create two files from `.env.example`:

1. **`.env`** — for local development
2. **`.env.prod`** — for Railway deployment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.example .env.prod
```

Fill both files with your secrets. The key differences:

| Variable | `.env` (local) | `.env.prod` (Railway) |
|---|---|---|
| `NODE_ENV` | `development` | `production` |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | `http://localhost:5173` | `https://your-app.up.railway.app` |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | `http://localhost:3001` | `https://your-app.up.railway.app` |
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:3001` | *(leave empty)* |
| `APP_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:5173` | `https://your-app.up.railway.app` |

All other variables (database URL, secrets, API keys) are the same in both files.

`make deploy` reads `.env.prod` and uploads its values to Railway. Local `make dev` reads `.env`.

Never commit `.env` or `.env.prod`. Both are gitignored via the `.env*` pattern.

## Design mocks

The `mocks/` folder contains wireframe prototypes that define the target user flows:

- `mocks/vendor-onboarding-prototype.html` — 15-screen onboarding journey with buyer, platform, and vendor lanes.
- `mocks/index.html` — GitHub Pages redirect.
- `mocks/README.md` — Details from the upstream mock repository.

Open `mocks/vendor-onboarding-prototype.html` in a browser to view the wireframes. All feature implementation follows these mocks.

## Project status

Early development — the repository is being scaffolded. Features listed above
describe the intended scope and will land incrementally.
